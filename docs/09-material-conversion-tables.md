## Stud Counts per Linear Foot
| Stud Spacing | Studs per 10' | Studs per 100' | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16" O.C. | 8 | 75 | `(length in inches / 16) + 1` |
| 19.2" O.C. | 6 | 62 | `(length in inches / 19.2) + 1` |
| 24" O.C. | 5 | 50 | `(length in inches / 24) + 1` |

## Plate Boards per Linear Foot
Assuming 16' boards and three-plate system (bottom + double top).
| Total Wall Length (ft) | LF of Plates (×3) | 16' Boards (no waste) | Recommended Boards (+10%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 40 | 120 | 7.5 | 9 |
| 80 | 240 | 15 | 17 |
| 120 | 360 | 22.5 | 25 |
| 160 | 480 | 30 | 33 |

## Siding Conversions
| Item | Conversion |
| --- | --- |
| Square feet to siding squares | `sq ft ÷ 100` |
| Starter strip | Perimeter of walls to be sided |
| Corner posts | Count corners × wall height |
| J-channel around openings | `(2 × width) + (2 × height)` per opening |
| Waste factor (vinyl/lap siding) | 10% simple, 12–15% complex |

## Roofing Conversions
| Item | Conversion |
| --- | --- |
| Square feet to squares | `sq ft ÷ 100` |
| Squares to bundles (3-tab/asphalt) | `squares × 3` |
| Underlayment rolls (synthetic) | `squares ÷ 10` (check manufacturer) |
| Ridge/hip cap | `ridge + hip LF + 10%` |
| Starter strip | Perimeter of eaves |

## Decking (4' × 8' Sheets)
| Roof or Floor Area (sq ft) | Sheets @ 32 sq ft | Sheets +10% Waste |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 640 | 20 | 22 |
| 960 | 30 | 33 |
| 1,280 | 40 | 44 |
| 1,600 | 50 | 55 |

Formula: `Sheets = (Area ÷ 32) × 1.10` (round up).

## Concrete Conversions
| Item | Conversion |
| --- | --- |
| Cubic feet to cubic yards | `cu ft ÷ 27` |
| 80-lb bags per cubic yard | `27 cu ft × (1 bag / 0.6 cu ft) ≈ 45 bags` |
| 60-lb bags per cubic yard | `27 ÷ 0.45 ≈ 60 bags` |

## Typical Waste Factors
| Category | Recommended Waste |
| --- | --- |
| Stud framing | 5% (cutting, damaged pieces) |
| Plates & blocking | 5% |
| Roof decking | 10% |
| Shingles | 10% simple roofs, 12% complex |
| Siding | 10% vinyl/lap, 12% board-and-batten |
| Concrete | 5% slabs, 10% footings/piers |

## Quick Reference Formulas
- **Slope Factor:** `√(rise² + run²) / run`. Common slopes: 4:12=1.054, 5:12=1.083, 6:12=1.118, 8:12=1.202.
- **Gable Area:** `(base × height) / 2`.
- **Stud Count:** `(wall length in inches / spacing) + 1 + corner/intersection extras`.
- **Header Stock:** `number of openings × header length × members per header`.
