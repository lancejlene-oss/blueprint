# Chapter 1 · Introduction

## Purpose of This Manual
Ritter Lumber salespeople act as translators between architectural drawings and job-site deliveries. This manual gives a structured path for turning any residential plan set into verified material quantities, even if you have never performed a takeoff before. Each chapter builds on the previous one so that, by the end, you can complete a full takeoff, document your assumptions, and communicate confidently with builders.

## Learning Outcomes
By working through the manual in order, you will be able to:
- Interpret every sheet inside a typical home plan set and recognize the information that affects material counts.
- Read and scale floor plans, elevations, sections, and schedules without guesswork.
- Convert architectural dimensions into lumber, panel, concrete, and finish-material quantities using standard formulas.
- Spot plan revisions, alternates, and code notes that change what must be priced.
- Record takeoff decisions on printable worksheets so that another salesperson can audit your work.

## How to Use the Manual
1. **Progress sequentially.** Later chapters assume you have mastered earlier vocabulary and processes.
2. **Replicate the examples.** Rework every numeric example by hand or in a spreadsheet so the math becomes second nature.
3. **Practice on real plans.** After each chapter, pull a current Ritter Lumber plan set and find the corresponding information on those sheets.
4. **Document assumptions.** Any time you make an estimation choice (stud spacing, waste, grade changes), write it on the worksheets so the project manager knows what was priced.
5. **Leverage the diagrams.** Each chapter references diagrams housed under `docs/img/`. Even if the graphics are not printed yet, the descriptions explain the intent so you can visualize the layout.

| 04 | Wall framing takeoff: studs, plates, headers, example calculations |
| 05 | Roof takeoff: geometry, slope factors, decking, shingles |
| 06 | Elevations & siding: façade analysis, siding squares, waste |
| 07 | Foundation & concrete: slabs, footings, rebar, volume math |
| 08 | Window & door schedules: interpreting tags and framing needs |
| 09 | Material conversion tables: quick-reference multipliers |
| 10 | Full example house takeoff: step-by-step quantities |

## Tools You Will Need
- Printed or digital plan set (PDF with scale bar preferred).
- Scale ruler for paper plans; PDF measurement tool for digital sets.
- Basic calculator or spreadsheet (Excel, Sheets, or company estimating software).
- Highlighters for paper sets, or layered markups in Bluebeam/PlanSwift.
- This manual (digital or printed) and the master worksheets for recording counts.

## Success Check
Before moving to Chapter 2, confirm you can:
- Explain in your own words why documenting assumptions prevents supply disputes.
- List the plan sheets you expect in a typical residential set.
- Describe how you will keep your takeoff organized (colors, worksheets, filenames).

A confident “yes” for each item means you are ready to orient yourself to the actual plan sheets in the next chapter.
