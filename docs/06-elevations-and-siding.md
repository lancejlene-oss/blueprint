# Chapter 6 · Elevations & Siding

## Why Elevations Matter
Elevations reveal vertical dimensions, cladding transitions, trim details, and special façade treatments that floor plans cannot show. Accurate siding takeoffs require understanding every wall face, gable height, and opening deduction.

## Key Concepts
- **Elevation Sheets:** Usually labeled `A4.x`. Each sheet shows front, rear, and side views with grade lines, finished floor elevations, ridge heights, and siding callouts.
- **Wall vs Gable Areas:** Wall area = width × height (plate to grade). Gable area = (base × height) / 2. Add them for total façade coverage.
- **Siding Squares:** 1 square = 100 sq ft, same as roofing. Manufacturers often package vinyl/engineered siding per square.
- **Openings Deduction:** Subtract the actual area of doors and windows. Add back trim boards separately if priced per piece.
- **Waste Factors:** Siding typically uses 7–10% waste depending on complexity and cutting patterns.

## Diagram Reference
![Elevation siding areas](img/elevation-siding-areas.svg)
The diagram shows a front elevation with labeled width (36'), plate height (8'), gable peak height (4'), window/door dimensions, and shaded regions identifying rectangular wall areas and triangular gable areas. Break lines indicate where to subtract openings and add trim.

## Step-by-Step Siding Takeoff
1. **Capture Elevation Dimensions:** Note overall width, plate height, and gable rise. If not dimensioned, derive from the roof slope and span (e.g., 6:12 slope over 18' run = 9' ridge height above plate, so gable rise = 9').
2. **Calculate Rectangular Wall Area:** Multiply width × plate height for each façade section.
3. **Calculate Gable Area:** Use `(base × height) / 2`. Add to wall area for the façade total.
4. **Subtract Openings:** For each door/window, multiply width × height. Deduct from façade totals.
5. **Add Waste:** Multiply net area by (1 + waste percentage). Typical vinyl siding waste = 10% for simple façades, 12–15% for complex angles.
6. **Convert to Squares:** Divide final area by 100. Round up to the nearest half square.
7. **Record Trim and Accessories:** Note linear footage of corner posts, starter strip, J-channel, and fascia/soffit as required.

## Worked Example: Front Elevation with Gable
- **Dimensions:** Width 36', plate height 8', central gable width 16' with peak 4' above plate. Siding is vinyl; waste target 10%.
- **Wall Area:** 36' × 8' = 288 sq ft.
- **Gable Area:** Base 16', height 4' ⇒ (16 × 4)/2 = 32 sq ft.
- **Total Gross Area:** 288 + 32 = 320 sq ft.
- **Openings:** Entry door 3' × 6'-8" (20 sq ft), two windows 3' × 5' each (15 sq ft × 2 = 30 sq ft). Total openings = 50 sq ft.
- **Net Area:** 320 - 50 = 270 sq ft.
- **Waste:** 270 × 1.10 = 297 sq ft.
- **Squares:** 297 / 100 = 2.97 ⇒ order 3.0 squares for this elevation.
- **Trim:** Corner posts (two 8' corners). J-channel around openings: perimeter = 2 × (3' + 5') = 16' per window, 19.3' for the door. Record these separately.

## Tips & Common Mistakes
- **Tip:** Create a façade worksheet listing each elevation to keep deductions organized.
- **Tip:** When siding changes at different heights (e.g., stone wainscot to 3'), split the calculation into zones and note transition trims.
- **Mistake:** Forgetting gable vent or louver openings, which should be deducted or substituted with vent kits.
- **Mistake:** Applying the same waste to board-and-batten as to lap siding; vertical products need more waste for staggering joints.

## Recap
You can now translate elevation dimensions into siding squares with proper deductions and waste. The next chapter extends these measurement skills to foundation and concrete work.
