# Chapter 3 · Floor Plan Reading

## Why Floor Plans Drive the Takeoff
Floor plans show every wall, opening, and symbol that determines framing, finishes, and mechanical rough-ins. Reading them accurately allows you to quantify materials and catch architectural intent before it becomes a job-site question.

## Key Concepts
- **Wall Types:** Exterior walls typically drawn with thicker line weights and hatching; interior partitions use thinner lines. Legends define whether walls are 2x4, 2x6, or specialty assemblies.
- **Openings:** Doors, windows, cased openings, and overhead doors share similar symbols with swing arcs or roller indications. Tags like `D3` or `W2` tie back to schedules.
- **Dimension Strings:** Outer strings provide overall building width/length, middle strings locate structural grids, and inner strings locate openings and interior walls. Read them from exterior to interior.
- **Symbols & Callouts:** Electrical outlets, plumbing fixtures, section cuts, and detail bubbles appear across the plan. Each symbol should be understandable using the sheet’s legend or a company standard.

## Diagram Reference
![Floor plan basics](img/floor-plan-basic.svg)
The diagram depicts a simplified first-floor plan with thick exterior walls, thinner interior partitions, swing arcs on doors, window tags (`W1`, `W2`), dual dimension strings (overall and segment), and callouts pointing to sections (`A5/2`). Grid lines `A-D` and `1-4` show how to align notes between sheets.

## Step-by-Step Reading Process
1. **Trace the Perimeter:** Highlight the exterior wall centerline. Note wall thickness changes (e.g., 2x6 front elevation, 2x4 sides).
2. **Identify Structural Walls:** Look for double-line hatching or notes like “bearing wall” that require different stud counts or beams.
3. **Mark Openings:** Circle each door and window, writing its tag next to it. Confirm swing direction so headers are sized correctly later.
4. **Read Dimension Strings:** Start with the overall dimension to confirm building size. Move inward to locate wall segments and opening centers. Record anomalies (like odd spacing) for later review.
5. **Catalog Symbols:** Use the legend to identify fixtures. Even if you do not price electrical or plumbing, knowing fixture locations helps validate room layouts and opening counts.
6. **Follow Callouts:** Section bubbles (e.g., `2/A5.1`) tell you where to find additional construction info. Tab those sheets before you start counting framing around that condition.

## Worked Example: Reading a Living Area Layout
- A 36'-0" x 24'-0" footprint has exterior walls labeled "2x6 stud wall @ 16" O.C., R-21 insulation" on the legend.
- Interior partitions are noted as "2x4 stud wall @ 16" O.C." By measuring dimension strings, you find a 12'-0" living room wall with two interior doors (`D2`) and one cased opening (`CO1`).
- Window tags `W1` (3040) and `W3` (3050) appear with centerline dimensions from the adjacent corner called out in the inner dimension string.
- Electrical symbols show a ceiling fan in the living room; while you do not price it, the symbol confirms the plan is the correct sheet (not a structural-only floor plan).

## Tips & Common Mistakes
- **Tip:** Use different highlighter colors: yellow for walls, green for windows, blue for doors. It speeds up re-checking later.
- **Tip:** When a dimension string seems off (e.g., numbers do not add up to the overall dimension), look for small jogs or wall thickness notes.
- **Mistake:** Ignoring interior step-downs or ceiling height transitions called out in bubbles; they can affect stud lengths and trim packages.
- **Mistake:** Misreading pocket doors as cased openings; check for the dashed pocket outline inside the wall.

## Self-Check Worksheet
| Item to Locate | Notes from Your Plan Set |
| --- | --- |
| Longest exterior wall length | |
| Thickest wall assembly (dimension and location) | |
| Total number of door tags | |
| Total number of window tags | |
| Dimension reference for the kitchen sink centerline | |

### Additional Prompts
1. List three symbols you did not recognize at first and describe how you decoded them.
2. Identify any notes that change standard wall spacing or materials.
3. Mark one section callout and record the sheet and detail number it references.

## Recap
You can now read floor plans with confidence: differentiating wall types, locating openings, interpreting dimension strings, and cross-referencing symbols. This skill sets up the precise counting required in the framing chapter.
