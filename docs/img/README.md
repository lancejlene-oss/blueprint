# Diagram Production Notes

Use this checklist when creating the vector diagrams referenced throughout the manual. Each image should be saved in SVG format at 300 dpi equivalent so the final PDF prints cleanly.

Add additional diagrams as needed, following the same naming convention `lowercase-with-hyphens.svg` and documenting them here so authors and designers stay synchronized.
