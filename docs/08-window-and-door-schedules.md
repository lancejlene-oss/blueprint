# Chapter 8 · Window & Door Schedules

## Why Schedules Are Critical
Floor plans show where openings go, but schedules specify exact sizes, types, and remarks that determine framing requirements and material pricing. Reading schedules accurately prevents wrong-size units and job-site reorders.

## Key Concepts
- **Tags:** Symbols like `W2` or `D1` placed on plans match rows in the schedule. Always cross-reference tag letters/numbers to ensure consistency.
- **Schedule Columns:** Typical columns include quantity, size (width × height), type (casement, slider, hinged), operation (XO, OX, fixed), materials, glass notes, and remarks (e.g., tempered, egress).
- **Rough Opening (RO):** Framing hole size. General guidance: windows are usually +1/2" in width and height compared to net unit size. Doors usually require +2" width and +2-1/2" height to accommodate jambs and shims.
- **Special Instructions:** Mullions, grids, SDL patterns, or impact ratings appear in remarks and may influence framing (e.g., additional king studs for wide mulled units).

## Diagram Reference

The diagram shows a cropped schedule with columns for Tag, Quantity, Size, Type, Operation, RO, Remarks, plus plan callouts pointing from a floor plan window label (`W3`). It also highlights how a double door (`D2`) references a note for sidelites.

## Step-by-Step Schedule Process
1. **Locate the Schedule Sheet:** Often `A8.x` or a dedicated window/door sheet. Confirm there are no supplemental schedules in structural or spec books.
2. **Verify Tags:** Scan the plan to ensure every tag appears in the schedule. If a plan tag lacks a schedule entry, circle it and alert the designer or builder.
3. **Record Framing Needs:** For each window/door, note the RO, header size (if provided), mull requirements, and special hardware. Add these to your wall takeoff worksheets.
4. **Group Similar Units:** Summarize quantities per size to speed ordering and reduce data entry errors.
5. **Check Remarks:** Flag tempered, egress, impact, or obscured glass requirements—they affect pricing and may change framing (e.g., safety glazing near tubs).
6. **Document Delivery/Installation Notes:** Some schedules include Nailing fin vs. block frame instructions; capture them to avoid field confusion.

## Example Mini Schedule
| Tag | Qty | Size (WxH) | Type | Operation | Rough Opening | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | 4 | 3040 | Vinyl single-hung | XO | 3'-0 1/2" × 4'-0 1/2" | Tempered @ Bath, standard elsewhere |
| W2 | 2 | 3050 | Vinyl picture | Fixed | 3'-0 1/2" × 5'-0 1/2" | Align heads with adjacent W1 |
| D1 | 1 | 3068 | Fiberglass entry | Inswing | 3'-2" × 6'-10 1/2" | Include sidelight framing each side |
| D2 | 2 | 2068 | Interior hollow-core | Swing | 2'-2" × 6'-10 1/2" | Pocket door kit in Bedroom 2 |

### Framing Impact
- **W1:** Requires standard header (per structural schedule), jack studs each side, sill framing for single-hung unit, tempered glass at bath per remark (no framing change but note for ordering).
- **W2:** Larger header (often (2) 2x10). Since heads align, maintain consistent rough opening height even if sill heights differ.
- **D1:** Entry door rough opening width 3'-2" accommodates jamb plus sidelight framing. Plan for doubled king studs per side.
- **D2:** Pocket door note means removing the standard jack studs on one side and substituting kit framing. Document this so the framer orders the kit and extra blocking.

## Tips & Common Mistakes
- **Tip:** Create a spreadsheet filtered by tag to check that plan counts equal schedule counts.
- **Tip:** Use remarks to plan for additional trim packages or specialty hardware.
- **Mistake:** Ignoring rough opening callouts and framing walls to nominal sizes; the door/window installer will reject the framing.
- **Mistake:** Missing tempered-glass requirements within 24" of doors or near wet areas, leading to last-minute replacements.

## Recap
You can now match plan tags to schedule data, determine rough openings, and capture framing adjustments. These skills ensure the framing counts from Chapter 4 align with the actual units ordered.
