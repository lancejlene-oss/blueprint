# Chapter 5 · Roof Takeoff

## Why Roof Measurements Differ from Floor Area
Roof surface area depends on slope and geometry, not just the building footprint. A quick count based on plan rectangles misses extra surface at hips, valleys, and overhangs, leading to material shortages. This chapter shows how to convert plan data into accurate decking, underlayment, and shingles.

## Key Concepts
- **Roof Geometry:** Ridges run horizontally across peak lines, hips project outward where roof planes meet, valleys run inward where planes intersect, and eaves are the lower edges with overhangs.
- **Slope vs Pitch:** Slope uses rise over run (e.g., 6" rise per 12" run). Pitch compares rise to span (e.g., 6:12 pitch equals 6:24 slope). Use slope when applying conversion factors.
- **Slope Factor:** Multiply the horizontal (plan) length by `√(rise² + run²) / run` to get roof surface length. Common 6:12 slope factor is 1.118.
- **Squares & Bundles:** 1 roofing square = 100 sq ft. Asphalt shingles typically use 3 bundles per square.
- **Decking Sheets:** Standard 4'x8' OSB/plywood covers 32 sq ft. Add waste for angled cuts.

## Diagram Reference

The diagram pairs a plan view of a simple gable roof showing ridge line, eave overhangs, and dimension strings with a section demonstrating a 6:12 slope triangle (6" rise, 12" run) and the resulting slope factor. Valleys and hips are labeled on secondary planes to reinforce terminology.

## Step-by-Step Roof Takeoff
1. **Identify Roof Plan Sheets:** Look for `A3.x` or structural roof framing sheets. Confirm slope callouts (e.g., note “Roof = 6:12”).
2. **Measure Horizontal Areas:** Outline each roof plane on the plan, including overhangs. Multiply length × width for each rectangle/triangle.
3. **Apply Slope Factor:** Multiply each horizontal area by the slope factor to get true surface area. Common factors: 4:12 = 1.054, 6:12 = 1.118, 8:12 = 1.202.
4. **Add Hips/Valleys Waste:** Complex roofs need an additional 5–10% to cover diagonal cuts and starter/hip cap shingles.
5. **Calculate Decking:** Divide total roof surface area by 32 sq ft per sheet. Round up and add 10% waste.
6. **Convert to Squares and Bundles:** Divide area by 100 to get squares, then multiply squares × 3 for bundles (or per manufacturer requirement).
7. **Record Accessory Items:** Note ridge vent length (usually ridge length), drip edge linear footage (perimeter eaves + rakes), and underlayment rolls (typical 4 squares per roll for 2-ply felt or per product data).

## Worked Example: Simple Gable Roof
- **Footprint:** 24' x 36' rectangle, 1'-0" eaves on all sides. Horizontal dimensions become 26' x 38'.
- **Horizontal Area:** 26' × 38' = 988 sq ft.
- **Slope Factor (6:12):** 1.118. Roof surface area = 988 × 1.118 ≈ 1,104 sq ft.
- **Shingle Squares:** 1,104 / 100 = 11.04 squares. Add 10% waste ⇒ 12.14 squares ⇒ order 13 squares (39 bundles).
- **Decking Sheets:** 1,104 / 32 = 34.5 sheets. Add 10% = 38 sheets.
- **Ridge Length:** 36'. Ridge vent (or cap) equals 36' + 10% overlap = 40'.
- **Drip Edge:** Perimeter = (2 × 38') + (2 × 26') = 128'. Add 5% = 135'.
- **Underlayment:** If each synthetic roll covers 10 squares, you need 1.3 rolls; order 2 rolls to cover waste and overlaps.

## Tips & Common Mistakes
- **Tip:** Create a slope factor cheat sheet (also provided in Chapter 9) and tape it to your monitor for quick reference.
- **Tip:** For hips and valleys, count linear footage separately for ridge/hip cap accessories and metal valley flashing.
- **Mistake:** Forgetting to include porch roofs or garage wings with different slopes—handle each plane independently.
- **Mistake:** Using plan area without overhangs; decking and shingles extend to the eave edge, not the wall line.

## Recap
You can now translate plan geometry and slope notes into accurate roof surface areas, decking sheet counts, and shingle bundles. This ensures the framing lumber takeoff you performed feeds cleanly into the roof package.
